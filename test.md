# IoTrim
Consumer IoT devices come with convenient services. However, since there are few strict privacy/security regulations and standards in the IoT context, device abuse is increasingly becoming a major privacy/security issue for consumers worldwide. 

IoTrim, automatically monitors and blocks non-essential network activities, and identifies IoT devices’ information exposure and security threats, using privacy-preserving AI techniques to build insights and behavioral models from devices.
IoTrim components run on the home router, and can be controlled through a smartphone app, a computer or the user’s voice (It offers easy-to-use, plug and play protection). 

IoTrim prevents violations of individuals’ privacy by intercepting and blocking information exposure to third-party analytics and service providers, most of which are collecting personal data unbeknownst to the user and potentially breaking privacy regulations such as the GDPR and CCPA.

The design of the testing system (<a href="https://github.com/IoTrim/IoTrigger">IoTrigger</a>), the blocking system (<a href="https://github.com/IoTrim/IoTrimmer">IoTrimmer</a>), the <a href="https://github.com/IoTrim/ML">AI Engine</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/IoTrim/iotrimlist">IoTrim list</a> have now been released!
